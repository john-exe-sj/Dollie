Dollie is an intelligent Discord bot built using `discord.py` and `langchain-groq`. Hosted on Amazon Web Services, it processes user messages asynchronously and provides AI-powered responses through Groq's language models, specifically designed to help children aged 6+ with programming and computer science questions.

## ‚ú® Features

### Core Functionality

- **Smart Message Detection**: Responds to messages mentioning "Dollie" or through role and direct mentions
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Handles multiple requests efficiently using a message queue system
- **Session Management**: Maintains conversation history per user with automatic cleanup
- **Child-Friendly AI**: Specifically designed responses for children ages 6 and older
- **Command Support**: Built-in command system with configurable prefix

### Advanced Features

- **Intelligent Response Handling**: Automatically handles responses of varying lengths
  - Short responses: Direct message
  - Medium responses: Discord embeds
  - Long responses: File attachments
- **Role-Based Mentions**: Responds to both direct mentions and role mentions
- **Channel Restrictions**: Configurable channel access control
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Admin-only shutdown command with queue completion
- **Periodic Cleanup**: Automatic session cleanup to manage memory usage

## üöÄ Upcoming Features

- **File Processing**: Support for images and PDFs
- **Enhanced Context Management**:
  - Vector database for semantic context retrieval
  - Sliding window conversation history
  - Advanced token counting and management
  - Persistent storage for conversation history
- **Thread Support**: Ability to respond in Discord threads
- **Multi-Model Support**: Support for different AI models beyond Groq
