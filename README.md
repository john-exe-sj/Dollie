# TODO List
- [1] Create a query management system that queues a user's request: Dollie should be able to take in multiple requests in a single chatroom at the very least. 
- [2] Implement a strategy for Dollie to maintain a short term memory: User's able to make a query based on conversation prior. Avoid the use of text files. 
- [OPTIONAL] Maybe figure out a way to deploy this in the cloud: I don't want to run this locally if I can help it.
