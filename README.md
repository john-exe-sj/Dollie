Dollie is an intelligent Discord bot built using `discord.py` and `langchain-groq`. Hosted on Amazon Web Services, it processes user messages asynchronously and provides AI-powered responses through Groq's language models, specifically designed to help children aged 6+ with programming and computer science questions.

## ✨ Features
